# Java Learning II

This is now a mix of lessons from a Udemy course, as well as homework/labs from my CST classes at NYCCT.

If you haven't already, you can check out the first part _[here](https://github.com/Lexscher/Java_Learning)_. That being said, feel free to check out all of my previous commits.
